PolarProxy 1.0.2
* Fixed bug that prevented --nosni from working properly in TLS termination proxy mode. Thanks to msmnmy for reporting this issue on superuser.com!
* Added target_port match type to rulesets

PolarProxy 1.0.1
* Upgraded from .NET 6 to .NET 8
* Upgraded System.Security.Cryptography.Xml from version 4.5 to 9.0
* Improved resiliency of PCAP-over-IP listener. One broken session doesn't cause the PCAP-over-IP service to close.
* Added JA4 fingerprints to flow log (-f <file>)
* Added support for decrypt_fail_errorcode rules that match on specific error codes from authentication failures
* Added support for ruleset reload through SIGHUP

PolarProxy 1.0.0
* Changed PCAP output format from big-endian to little-endian 
* Reduced memory usage of PCAP logger
* Modified proxy logic to support also protocols where the server sends the first data, like FTP or SSH. Only works when "--nontls allow" is used and only in SOCKS or HAProxy modes.
* Improved handling of timeouts to avoid zombie sessions and tasks
* Improved ALPN logic for connections without SNI when --nosni is used. The client side ALPN is now mirrored by that of the server side.
* Fixed bug in "--cacert load" where leaf certs previously got incorrect Authority Key Identifier (AKI) X509v3 extension values if the root cert had an AKI. Thanks to Kevin Cook for reporting this bug!
* Fixed bug in HAProxy that caused PolarProxy to not see all proxied data from the client. Thanks to Isak Asp for reporting this bug!
* Added client's real IP and port (as reporeted by HAProxy) to decrypted PCAP for HAProxy connections. Thanks to Jereme Corrado for the heads up about the missing info.
* Added pcapoveripprivate, which only provides decrypted packets to/from the connecting client's own IP address.
* Added support for ruleset to run PolarProxy as a TLS firewall.
* Added support for setting bandwidth threshold in rule actions
* Splitted -v logging into -v (verbose) and -d (debug)

PolarProxy 0.9.10
* Improved error handling and error logging
* More reliable detection of certificate rejects by client for --bypassonfail

PolarProxy 0.9.9
* Modified and re-grouped command line arguments to use more logical names
* Added --leafcert noclone argument to force PolarProxy to always create new certificates
  for the requested SNI
* Added --notls argument to support forwarding of non-TLS traffic to a specified host
* Added --redirect option to redirect TLS connections for some domains

PolarProxy 0.9.8
* Added --timeout <seconds> argument to set TCP connection timout
* Added --bypassonfail argument to enable decryption bypass (fail-open) when
  failed connections have been observed for a particular client and server.
* Fewer error messages when -v isn't used

PolarProxy 0.9.0
 * Added support for SOCKS proxy (versions 4, 4a, 5 and 5h supported)
 * Added support for HTTP CONNECT proxy
 * Implemented automatic TLS detection for SOCKS and HTTP CONNECT proxy
 * Added Windows binary build

PolarProxy 0.8.16
 * Added "--bypassexact <file>" to bypass/disable decryption for specific domains.
   Decryption is disabled only for domains that exactly match a line in <file>.
 * Removed default value for "--outputdir" so that decrypted PCAP is not logged to disk
   unless -w <file> or -o <directory> is specified.
 * Added "--autoflush <seconds>" to allow buffered PCAP data and flow logs to be flushed
   to disk automatically on a regular interval.
 * Added "--pcapoveripconnect" to connect to a PCAP-over-IP listener and send
   a PCAP stream over TCP. Thanks to Andy Wick (of Moloch/Arkime fame) for the suggestion!
 * Added "--clientcert" option to allow client authentication using mTLS on outgoing
   connections from PolarProxy. Thanks to Peter Lambrechtsen for the idea!
 * Added "KillSignal=SIGINT" and "FinalKillSignal=SIGTERM" in PolarProxy.service to handle
   flushing of buffered pcap data better on systemctl stop and restart.
   Thanks to Mustafa Cantürk for reporting the issue!
 * Improved handling of license keys.

PolarProxy 0.8.15
 * Fixed server certificate selection bug.

PolarProxy 0.8.14
 * Added support for loading server certificates (aka leaf certificates) with --servercert
   This feature can be used in combination with --terminate and --connect to use PolarProxy
   as a TLS termination proxy.

PolarProxy 0.8.13
 * Added correct IPv4 checksums to PCAP data.

PolarProxy 0.8.12
 * Reduced default TCP MSS from 1500 to 1420 to get a smaller MTU.
 * Added --mss option to allow manual configuration of MSS and MTU

PolarProxy 0.8.11
 * Added --terminate option to support running PolarProxy as a TLS termination proxy

PolarProxy 0.8.9
 * Added "--connect <host>" switch in order to put PolarProxy in front of another proxy.
   Thanks to @MaliciousDelish for the feature request!* More descriptive error messages when TCP connections fail.
* Replaced --allownontls with --nontls allow, which was also extended with "forward"
  and "encrypt" actions

PolarProxy 0.9.7
 * Added support for HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 (send-proxy) with --haproxy
 * Fixed Subject Alternative Name issue in --terminate mode, where value accidentally
   got set to "DNS Name=CN={DOMAIN}" instead of "DNS Name={DOMAIN}".
   Thanks to AlMo for reporting the bug.

PolarProxy 0.9.6
 * Relaxed certificate validation procedure for "client styled auth" to avoid
   unnessasary re-connection attempts with "safe SSL auth".
 * Improved impersonation of self-signed certificates
 * Improved --help documentation
